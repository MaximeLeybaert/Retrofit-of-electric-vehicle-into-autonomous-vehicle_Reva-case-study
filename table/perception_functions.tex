Module Name & Functionality & sensors & location & output type\\

Lane detection \& classification & Where are the lines? (straight, curved, etc.) What do they look like (dotted, plain, right or left, etc.) & Camera, LiDAR & Front of the car, Road level, FOV should focus on the road width and high & Model of the lines, (car) relative position of the lines, classification of the lines \\
\hline \hline

On road signs detection \& classification & Recognize on road symbols (left, straight arrow,...) and text (direction, stop...) & Camera, LiDAR & same as above & relative position and classification  \\
\hline \hline

Drivelable area detection & Detect the road area where the car could drive & Camera, LiDAR & front (sure) back?, top level max FOV oriented at the road and above &  semantic structure with road label  \\
\hline \hline

Object detection \& Classification & Delimit the surface or volume occupied by an object (typically road user) and classify the object (pedestrian, car, truck, cyclist, etc.) & Camera, LiDAR & 360 degree FOV & Boxen raw data (this thing is occupying that area) and this thing is a (car, e.g.)\\
\hline \hline

Object Tracking & Track the object that are detected and classified & Camera, LiDAR, RADAR & 360 FOV &  A given motion state to each object (position, steady [y,n], direction, speed, (mostly a trajectory). \\
